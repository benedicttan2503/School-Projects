# School-Projects
## Pizza Shop
This was my first Python project. It does calculations for a pizza shop by figuring out the cost of certain pizzas and pizza-related items and letting the user interact with the program through a menu of different options.
## Escape Room
A mini assignment for school where I came up with my own scenario, and implemented a number of valid commands that the player could type in.
